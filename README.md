# libnemomw

`libnemomw` is a simple way to dynamically or statically build against 
nemo middleware. 

`libnemomw` comes as a kit. You can build it as a dynamic or a static 
library that can contain more or less features. To build `libnemomw`, 
you need to use a collection of `.pri` files included in another project
file.
